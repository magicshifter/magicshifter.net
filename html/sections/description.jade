      The MagicShifter 3000 is an open source hardware gadget for RGB lighting, gaming and POV (persistence of vision) applications. By combining its accelerometer with 16 bright RGB LEDs you can draw images “into the air”. It’s only 103x27x13mm so it fits in every pocket. The MagicShifter 3000 is the latest and most advanced addition to the  succesful MagicShifter series.

        Control it via WiFi, from your mobile phone and computer,
        or use it as a standalone magic lamp to create amazing shadow and lighting effects.
        The POV images are created by simply shaking the device.
        In contrast to other POV gadgets,
        the image is stabilized with the accelerometer data
        and displays the image in both directions.

        Magicshifter 3000 has a very robust hardware design.
        You can not damage the electronics by incorrect user code.
        All pins are protected against short circuit conditions that could be generated in software.
        Let the experiments start!
